These\norganizations are usually membership societies or government-sanctioned national\nauthorities which are intended to collect money from broadcasters to compensate\ncopyright holders. The royalty collection societies require payment before you\ncan stream just about any music released commercially to the general public -\nwhether you make any money out of streaming, or not. It's not so much the\npercentage of revenue demanded, but that there are usually annual minimum fees\nto pay, which can hurt small stations disproportionately."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"For example, in the UK, the MCPS-PRS Limited Online Music Licence covers\nnon-commercial music streaming by groups and individuals, as long as their gross\nrevenue is less then \xa312,500 per year. The cost is on a sliding scale, up to\n\xa31,120 plus 20% tax per year for delivering up to 450,000 individual streams or\nserving 25,000 files; after that, you have to apply for a full MCPS-PRS Online\nMusic Licence. That doesn't sound too bad at first, but 25,000 files per year\nworks out at less than four downloads per hour for a round-the-clock website.\nThis particular licence only covers publishing (songwriter) rights, not\nrecording (record label and musician's performance) rights, so you have to\nnegotiate an additional licence from Phonographic Performance Limited (PPL) to\nplay music online, including digital recordings converted from commercially\nreleased CDs, vinyl or tape."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"Typically, you have to provide full statistical details to the royalty society\nof all music streamed or downloaded from your site, which can be onerous. Even\nif your radio station is mostly speech, there are many limitations in the small\nprint of these music licences. For instance, you can't use music for\npromotional purposes, and you can't stream a whole opera, without negotiating\nseparate licences. Weirdly, you aren't allowed to play a piece of music in a\n'derogatory context' to the writer or performers; no drummer jokes allowed,\nthen."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"However, the biggest pitfall is that these MCPS-PRS licences for publishing\nrights only cover listeners in the UK. For recording rights, PPL is a member of\nthe IFPI reciprocal scheme for webcasters, which means its licenses cover\nlisteners in some European countries, Australia, New Zealand and a few other\ncountries, but not listeners in the USA or Canada. So if your Internet station\npicked up a significant number of listeners in countries not covered by the\nMCPS-PRS licences or the IFPI reciprocal scheme, you would have to pay for\nsimilar music licences in those countries as well. It's no wonder that many\nnot-for-profit radio stations have disappeared from the virtual airwaves over\nthe last few years, since not having the right licences could leave the operator\nliable to legal action."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"If you want to go down the commercial music route, check out the\n",(0,i.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://www.prsformusic.com"},"https://www.prsformusic.com")," and ",(0,i.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"https://www.ppluk.com"},"https://www.ppluk.com")," websites for UK licence\ndetails.
