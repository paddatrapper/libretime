Apart from the software license, the main difference between these two servers is that Icecast supports simultaneous MP3, AAC, Ogg Vorbis or Ogg Opus streaming from LibreTime, whereas SHOUTcast only supports MP3 and AAC streams. The royalty-free Ogg Vorbis format has the advantage of better sound quality than MP3 at lower bitrates, which has a direct impact on the amount of bandwidth that your station will require to serve the same number of listeners. Ogg Opus also benefits from good sound quality at low bitrates, with the added advantage of lower latency than other streaming formats. Opus is now an IETF standard and requires Icecast 2.4 or later to be installed on the streaming server.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"admin-manual/troubleshooting":{"id":"admin-manual/troubleshooting","title":"Troubleshooting","description":"This guide walk you though the steps required to troubleshoot LibreTime.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"admin-manual/tutorials/setup-a-firewall-using-ufw":{"id":"admin-manual/tutorials/setup-a-firewall-using-ufw","title":"How to setup a firewall using UFW","description":"This tutorials will walk you though the steps required to setup a firewall using UFW.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"admin-manual/tutorials/setup-a-static-ip-using-netplan":{"id":"admin-manual/tutorials/setup-a-static-ip-using-netplan","title":"How to setup a static ip using Netplan","description":"This tutorials will walk you though the steps required to configure a server static IP address by modifying the Netplan configuration.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"admin-manual/uninstall":{"id":"admin-manual/uninstall","title":"Uninstall","description":"This guide provide some guidance to uninstall LibreTime from your system.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"appendix/hd-audio-modules":{"id":"appendix/hd-audio-modules","title":"HD Audio modules","description":"This listing is provided to help ensure that the correct model parameter is passed to the ALSA kernel module for an Intel HDA soundcard, if one is fitted to your LibreTime server.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"appendix/rights-royalties":{"id":"appendix/rights-royalties","title":"Rights and royalties","description":"If you\'re new to broadcasting, or have not streamed your station online before,","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"developer-manual/design/architecture":{"id":"developer-manual/design/architecture","title":"Architecture","description":"This document explains the design details and goals for the architecture of LibreTime.

On fresh installation, the database is filled with the schema.sql and data.sql files and LibreTime won\'t run any sql migration on top of it.
